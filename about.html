    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate Mechatronics Engineering student with hands-on experience in both hardware and software projects. My work spans across automation systems, embedded solutions, robotics, IoT applications, and full-stack software development. I enjoy integrating mechanical design with electronics and intelligent programming to build innovative, real-world solutions. With a strong foundation in sensors, microcontrollers, manufacturing processes, and modern software tools, I continuously explore new technologies to improve efficiency and create smart systems. I am always eager to learn, experiment, and bring ideas to life through practical engineering.
