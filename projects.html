        <h3>Autonomous Line-Following and Obstacle-Avoiding Robot,</h3>
        <p>A smart robot built using IR sensors and microcontroller programmed to follow a track accurately.where I built a robotic platform using IR sensors, ultrasonic modules, DC motors, and an Arduino controller. I programmed the robot with PID-based line-tracking logic, real-time obstacle detection, and smooth motor control algorithms, enabling it to navigate intelligently.</p>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>IoT-Based Smart Home Automation System</h3>
        <p>I  developed an IoT-based Smart Home Automation System capable of monitoring environmental conditions and controlling home appliances remotely. On the hardware side, the system uses an ESP32 microcontroller, temperature–humidity sensors, a PIR motion sensor, an LDR, and relay modules to switch appliances like lights and fans. The setup also includes proper power regulation and safety circuits for secure operation.</p>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>CNC Mini-Plotter / XY Drawing Machine</h3>
        <p>Another significant project I built is a CNC Mini-Plotter Machine, designed to draw images and patterns with high precision. The hardware includes an Arduino UNO, NEMA 17 stepper motors, A4988 motor drivers, a pen-lifting servo, and a mechanical frame made using aluminium rails and linear bearings for smooth movement. Timing belts and pulleys allow accurate X–Y axis positioning.</p>
